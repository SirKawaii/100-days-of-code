### Day 16: October 15, 2019 23:01pm
##### (Polimorphism)

**Today's Progress**: End with polimorphism

**Thoughts**: Finally we end with this topic, In an era where javascript and python are the kings I don't know how could use this information in new projects, we should know in order to understand old code and give support to anothers projects but i thing the funtional programing is more explicit and less criptic.
Tomorrow finally I going to study lambda expresions! üòÉ
