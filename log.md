##### A day to start and go ahead.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** Puedo empezar esto en espa√±ol? maybe not, I could do this in english, is hard but I know I can, like the song.
Today I start to re-learn by a course the fundamentals of C#, I use C# everyday in my work but i think I need to go more deep into this programing language.

I bought this course 2 years ago when I start my first formal job after I finish the university but I was not have the time to do it and I learn by the hard way in the job.

##### (StackOverFlowExeption)

**Today's Progress**: Loops and Object Oriented Programing secctions completed.

**Thoughts**: Loops quite be easy, but I feel the dificult part going to start now, Today I create my first StackOverFlow Exception in this course and... is interesting xD , learn diferents method to make member variables always is a good thing.
I'm very tired now, is almost 3 hours of extra coding, now I'm going to sleep. good night.
